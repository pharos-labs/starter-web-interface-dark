# Pharos Controls Starter Web Interface

The Starter Web Interface is designed to serve as a basic custom web interface for use with [Pharos Designer control products](https://www.pharoscontrols.com/designer/).

The Starter Web Interface can be used as is, or as a template for you to build your own custom interface. Control elements are dynamically generated based on information in your Pharos Designer 2 project file without the need to add triggers.
